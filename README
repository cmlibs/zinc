This software is the cmgui part of CMISS.
It is released under the Mozilla Public License v1.1

Further information, help pages, a tracker and a wiki is available at 
http://www.cmiss.org/cmgui/

This software was originally developed at The University of Auckland and 
the Copyright held by Auckland UniServices Ltd.
This development has been for over 15 years and this release is under ongoing
development.

The strengths of this development are field storage including many finite element
basis types, 3D visualisation and a mathematical field abstraction layer. 

It includes some modules which are being deprecated and phased out, and some
which under active development.
The graphical interface of cmgui-motif was orignially developed in Motif but will 
soon be completely replaced by cmgui-wx which is developed in wxWidgets.
The win32 port is almost an exact copy as the i686-linux cmgui-wx with most of the 
important user interface components included. Active development
The code is being redesigned so that rather than being an overall application
it is a core library used by multiple applications, this includes the starting
of a defined api directory, the building of perl and python interfaces and the
inclusion of the 3D windows in Linux and win32 in a mozilla component.
