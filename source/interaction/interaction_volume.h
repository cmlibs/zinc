Creates an Interaction_volume between the centres of <interaction_volume1> and

projection_matrix and viewport.

/*******************************************************************************
LAST MODIFIED : 30 March 2000

DESCRIPTION :
The projection_matrix maps part of real space onto normalised device coordinates
that vary from -1 to +1 in each direction x, y and z. These are left handed, so
that when projected onto an area of the screen:
x = -1 at the left of the viewport, +1 at the right;
y = -1 at the bottom of the viewport, +1 at the top;
z = -1 at the near clipping plane of the viewport, +1 at the far clipping plane.
This follows how OpenGL works.
The viewport transformation in OpenGL converts x and y into pixel coordinates in
the window, while z lies within the values given in glDepthRange(near,far).
Normally near=0.0 and far=1.0; these are the values used by Scene_viewers. When
OpenGL picking with the interaction_volume is performed, it will return depths
for each picked object that should be converted with:

  normalised_z=2.0*(depth-near_depth)/(far_depth-near_depth) - 1.0;

This function should then be called to convert <normalised_z> into a measure of
closeness appropriate to the <interaction_volume> type, which can be used to
work out the closest object to the pointer, where a lower value is closer.

Calculates the distance in real coordinates from the "centre" of the

to the viewer is paramount.

go across rows fastest, and the matrix is appropriate for premultiplying
model coordinates to give world coordinates, i.e.:
	<wx wy wz wh>T = <Modelview_matrix><mx my mz mh>T
It must therefore be transposed to be used by OpenGL.

/*******************************************************************************
LAST MODIFIED : 21 March 2005

DESCRIPTION :
Returns the point in the <interaction_volume> most appropriate for placing
an object. This is normally the centre, but in the case of ray_frustum it is
arbitratily chosen to be the centre of the view frustum on the ray.
In future this function may be just one of many for enquiring about the centre
abilities of the Interaction_volume, which may enable such features as placement
at the intersection of a ray and a surface/manifold in space.
If a <constraint_function> is supplied then a location will be passed to this
function, which is expected to adjust it to satisfy the constraints that it
represents.  This function will then adjust the location and call the
<constraint_function> iteratively until either the two locations converge or
it gives up.

int Interaction_volume_get_projection_matrix(

/*******************************************************************************
LAST MODIFIED : 3 April 2000

DESCRIPTION :
Returns a 4x4 <projection matrix> for <interaction_volume>. Note that values
go across rows fastest, and the matrix is appropriate for premultiplying
world coordinates to give normalised coordinates, i.e.:
	<wx wy wz wh>T = <Projection_matrix><mx my mz mh>T
It must therefore be transposed to be used by OpenGL.

The projection_matrix maps part of real space onto normalised device coordinates
that vary from -1 to +1 in each direction x, y and z. These are left handed, so
that when projected onto an area of the screen:
x = -1 at the left of the viewport, +1 at the right;
y = -1 at the bottom of the viewport, +1 at the top;
z = -1 at the near clipping plane of the viewport, +1 at the far clipping plane.
This follows how OpenGL works. The normalised device coordinates returned by
this function refer to the space of the interaction_volume itself. This is not
to be confused with the volume of space refered to by the projection_matrix
parameter for ray_frustum type which is yet to undergo a viewport/picking
transformation to give the matrix returned here.
