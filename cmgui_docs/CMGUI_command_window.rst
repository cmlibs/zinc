CMGUI Command Window
--------------------

This is the first window that appears when CMGUI is loaded.  It consists of standard menus at the top, and three panels below.  From top to bottom these are the history, command line, and output panels.  The history panel is where all commands that have been executed are displayed.  The second, single-line panel is the command line where commands may be entered directly.  The lowermost panel is the output panel; this displays the text output of commands, error messages, as well as help information.

The history and output areas have scrollbars that allow you to view all of the contents of these panels.  In the case of the history panel, this enables you to scroll back and click on commands - clicking on a command in the history panel will enter that command into the command line.  This command can then be edited and executed.  In the case of lengthy commands, this can save a lot of typing.  Double-clicking on a command in the history window will execute it immediately.

The output panel is where any text output from commands or error messages appears.  If something is not working in CMGUI, this panel is the first place to look for a reason.  This panel also displays the help information when you execute a command with the ? or ?? argument.
