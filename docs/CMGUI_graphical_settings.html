name="general-description-of-graphical-settings">General description of
graphical settings</a></h1>

<p>Graphical settings are the building blocks used to create any visualization
displayed in the CMGUI <a class="reference"
href="http://www.cmiss.org/cmgui/wiki/UsingCMGUITheGraphicsWindow">graphics
window</a>. They are created, edited, re-ordered and deleted from within the <a
class="reference"
href="http://www.cmiss.org/cmgui/wiki/UsingCMGUITheSceneEditorWindow">scene
editor</a>, or via the command line. All graphical settings have the following
settings in common:</p>
<ul class="simple">
  <li>Name: This allows you to set the name of the graphical setting.</li>
  <li>Coordinate field: This setting has a check box, which activates a
    drop-down menu showing a list of fields that can be selected as the
    coordinate field for the selected graphical setting.</li>
  <li>Select mode: This drop-down menu allows you to select different selection
    behaviours for the graphical setting: 
    <ul>
      <li>select_on - The default setting; graphical settings are able to be
        selected and selected items are highlighted by rendering in the
        <em>default_selected</em> material.</li>
      <li>no_select - No selection or highlighting of the graphical
      setting.</li>
      <li>draw_selected - only selected items are drawn.</li>
      <li>draw_unselected - only unselected items are drawn.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Material: This drop-down menu allows you to select which material should
    be used to render the graphical setting. Materials are defined and edited
    in the <a class="reference"
    href="http://www.cmiss.org/cmgui/wiki/UsingCMGUIMaterialEditor">material
    editor window</a>.</li>
  <li>Data: This setting has a check box which activates a drop-down menu. This
    menu allows you to select which field will be mapped on to the graphical
    setting, allowing you to colour the graphical setting according to the
    values of some field for example. The check box also activates the
    <em>spectrum</em> drop-down menu.</li>
  <li>Spectrum: This drop-down menu is used to select which spectrum is to be
    used to colour the graphical element according to the field selected in the
    <em>data</em> setting. Spectra are edited in the <a class="reference"
    href="http://www.cmiss.org/cmgui/wiki/UsingCMGUISpectrumEditor">spectrum
    editor window</a>.</li>
  <li>Selected material: This drop-down menu allows you to set which material
    will be used to render parts of the graphical setting which are
  selected.</li>
</ul>

name="the-eight-types-of-graphical-settings">The eight types of graphical
settings</a></h1>
<ul>
  <li><p class="first"><strong>node_points</strong></p>
    <p>Node points are used to visualize nodes. You can use <a
    class="reference"
    href="http://www.cmiss.org/cmgui/wiki/VisualizingFieldsAtPointsUsingGlyphs">glyphs</a>
    to represent node points. There are a range of built-in glyphs in CMGUI,
    and it is possible to create custom glyphs as well. <em>Node points</em>
    graphical settings have the following settings in addition to the common
    ones listed above:</p>
    <ul class="simple">
      <li>Glyph: this drop-down menu allows you to choose the glyph that will
        be rendered at the node points.</li>
      <li>Centre: this box allows you to offset the origin of the glyph in
        order to alter its placement at the node point.</li>
      <li>Base glyph size: This box allows you to enter a size (x,y,z) for the
        glyph in the same scale as the coordinate system for the region.</li>
      <li>Orientation/Scale: This check box enables a drop-down menu that
        allows selection of the field that the glyphs will be oriented and
        scaled according to.</li>
      <li>Scale factors: This box allows you to enter how each dimension scales
        according to the orientation/scale field value.</li>
      <li>Variable scale: This check box enables a drop-down menu that allows
        selection of the field that acts as the variable scale field. For more
        information on this and other of the <em>node points</em> options, see
        the document on working with <a class="reference"
        href="http://www.cmiss.org/cmgui/wiki/VisualizingFieldsAtPointsUsingGlyphs">glyphs</a>.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><p class="first"><strong>data_points</strong></p>
    <p>Data points are used to visualize data points. Like node points, they
    can be represented using <a class="reference"
    href="http://www.cmiss.org/cmgui/wiki/VisualizingFieldsAtPointsUsingGlyphs">glyphs</a>.
    They have the same settings as <em>node points</em>.</p>
  </li>
  <li><p class="first"><strong>lines</strong></p>
    <p>Lines are used to visualize 1D elements, or the edges of 2D or 3D
    elements. They are simple, unshaded lines that have a fixed, specified
    width. They have the following specific settings:</p>
    <ul class="simple">
      <li>Exterior: This check box will automatically only render lines on
        exterior surfaces of a mesh.</li>
      <li>Face: This check box enables a drop-down menu that allows you to
        choose which faces are drawn according to xi values. You can select
        xi=0 or 1 for each of the three xi-directions.</li>
      <li>Width: this allows you to specify the width of the lines in pixels.
        This is a constant width that does not scale according to the zoom
        level.</li>
    </ul>
    <p></p>
  </li>
  <li><p class="first"><strong>cylinders</strong></p>
    <p>Cylinders are used to visualize the same things as lines. They are
    shaded cylinders of a specified radius, with their number of sides
    specified by the <em>Circle discretization</em> setting in the <a
    class="reference"
    href="http://www.cmiss.org/cmgui/wiki/UsingCMGUITheSceneEditorWindow">scene
    editor</a> <em>General settings</em>. They have the following specific
    settings:</p>
    <ul class="simple">
      <li>Exterior: This check box will automatically only render lines on
        exterior surfaces of a mesh.</li>
      <li>Face: This check box enables a drop-down menu that allows you to
        choose which faces are drawn according to xi values. You can select
        xi=0 or 1 for each of the three xi-axes.</li>
      <li>Constant radius: This allows you to set the radius of the cylinders,
        in the units of the coordinate system.</li>
      <li>Scalar radius: This check box will activate a drop-down menu allowing
        you to select which field will be used to scale the radius of the
        cylinders. It will also activate a text box in which you can enter the
        scale factor, or how the scale field will scale the radius.</li>
      <li>Texture coordinates: This check box activates a drop-down menu that
        allows you to select which field will be used to position any textures
        applied by the material setting.</li>
    </ul>
    <p></p>
  </li>
  <li><p class="first"><strong>surfaces</strong></p>
    <p>Surfaces are used to visualize 2D elements or the faces of 3D elements.
    They are shaded surfaces of zero thickness that are automatically shaped
    according to the nodes defining the element they represent. Their level of
    detail is specified by the <em>Element discretization</em> setting in the
    <a class="reference"
    href="http://www.cmiss.org/cmgui/wiki/UsingCMGUITheSceneEditorWindow">scene
    editor</a> <em>General settings</em>. They have the following specific
    settings:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Exterior: This check box will automatically only
        render surfaces on exterior surfaces of a mesh.
      </li>
      <li>Face: This check box enables a drop-down menu that
        allows you to choose which faces are drawn according to xi values. You
        can select xi=0 or 1 for each of the three xi-axes.
      </li>
      <li>Render type: This drop down menu allows you to
        select shaded (default) or wireframe rendering of surfaces. Wireframe
        rendering renders the surfaces as grids of shaded lines, with the grid
        detail determined by the <em>element discretization</em> setting in the
        <em>General settings</em>.
      </li>
      <li>Texture coordinates: This check box activates a
        drop-down menu that allows you to select which field will be used to
        position any textures applied by the material setting.
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>

  <p></p>
  <li><p class="first"><strong>iso_surfaces</strong></p>
    <p>Iso-surfaces are used to represent a surface that connects all points
    that share some common value. For example, in <a class="reference"
    href="http://cmiss.bioeng.auckland.ac.nz/development/examples/a/a7/index.html">example
    a7</a> an iso-surface is used to represent a surface at which every point
    has a temperature of 100 degrees C. They have the following specific
    settings:</p>
    <ul class="simple">
      <li>Use element type: This drop down menu allows you to select which type
        of element will have surfaces rendered on it. Type
        <em>use_elements</em> is the default. The types <em>use_faces</em> and
        <em>use_lines</em> will render element points only on those components
        of elements. If faces or lines are chosen, the following options are
        activated: 
        <ul>
          <li>Exterior: This check box will automatically only render
            iso-surfaces on exterior surfaces of a mesh.</li>
          <li>Face: This check box enables a drop-down menu that allows you to
            choose on which faces iso-surfaces are drawn, according to xi
            values. You can select xi=0 or 1 for each of the three xi-axes.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>It is worth noting that if you select <em>use_surfaces</em> then the
    equivalent of iso-surfaces becomes iso-lines. If you select
    <em>use_lines</em> then you will not get any visual representation.</p>
    <ul class="simple">
      <li>Iso-scalar: This drop down menu allows you to select the field that
        the iso-surface will be rendered according to the values of.</li>
      <li>Iso-values: This settings box contains the following settings: 
        <ul>
          <li>List: This radio button activates a text box that allows you to
            enter a value at which to draw the iso-surface.</li>
          <li>Sequence: This radio button activates three text boxes that allow
            you to enter a sequence of evenly spaced values to draw
            iso-surfaces at. The <em>Number</em> box allows you to enter the
            number of iso-surfaces you want. The <em>First</em> and
            <em>Last</em> boxes allow you to enter the starting and ending
            values of the iso-surfaces. The sequence will automatically space
            the number of surfaces between these two values.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>Render type: This drop down menu allows you to select shaded
        (default) or wireframe rendering of surfaces. Wireframe rendering
        renders the surfaces as grids of shaded lines, with the grid detail
        determined by the <em>element discretization</em> setting in the
        <em>General settings</em>.</li>
      <li>Texture coordinates: This check box activates a drop-down menu that
        allows you to select which field will be used to position any textures
        applied by the material setting.</li>
    </ul>
    <p></p>
  </li>
  <li><p class="first"><strong>element_points</strong></p>
    <p>Element points are used to visualize the discretized points within an
    element. Elements may be 1, 2 or 3 dimensional, in which case the element
    points are spaced along the line, across the surface, or throughout the
    volume according to the <em>Element discretization</em> setting in the <a
    class="reference"
    href="http://www.cmiss.org/cmgui/wiki/UsingCMGUITheSceneEditorWindow">scene
    editor</a> <em>General settings</em>. They have the following specific
    settings:</p>
    <ul class="simple">
      <li>Use element type: This drop down menu allows you to select which type
        of element will have element points rendered on/in it. Type
        <em>use_elements</em> is the default, and renders element points
        throughout 3D elements. The types <em>use_faces</em> and
        <em>use_lines</em> will render element points only on those components
        of elements. If faces or lines are chosen, the following options are
        activated: 
        <ul>
          <li>Exterior: This check box will automatically only render element
            points on exterior surfaces of a mesh.</li>
          <li>Face: This check box enables a drop-down menu that allows you to
            choose on which faces element points are drawn according to xi
            values. You can select xi=0 or 1 for each of the three xi-axes.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>Xi discretization mode: this drop down menu allows you to select the
        method by which element points are distributed across the element.</li>
    </ul>
    <p></p>
  </li>
  <li><p class="first"><strong>streamlines</strong></p>
    <p>Streamlines are a special graphical setting for visualizing
    <em>vector</em> fields - for example, a fluid flow solution. They can be
    used to visualize 3, 6 or 9 component vector fields within a 3 dimensional
    element. In <a class="reference"
    href="http://cmiss.bioeng.auckland.ac.nz/development/examples/a/ao/index.html">example
    ao</a>, streamlines are used to show the fibre and sheet directions in the
    heart. Streamlines will align along their length according to the first
    vector of a vector field, and across their "width" (eg the width of the
    <em>ribbon</em> or <em>rectangle</em> streamline types) to the second
    vector. For single vector (3 component) vector fields, the width of the
    streamlines will align to the <a class="reference"
    href="http://www.math.umn.edu/~nykamp/m2374/readings/divcurl/">curl</a> of
    the vector.</p>
    <p>Note that streamlines can be quite expensive to compute; changes to
    streamline settings in the <a class="reference"
    href="http://www.cmiss.org/cmgui/wiki/UsingCMGUITheSceneEditorWindow">scene
    editor</a> can take several seconds to appear in the 3D window, especially
    for complex scenes.</p>
    <p>Streamlines have the following specific settings:</p>
    <ul class="simple">
      <li>Streamline type: This drop-down box allows you to select the shape of
        the streamlines; that is, the shape outline that is extruded along the
        length of the streamline. <em>Line</em> and <em>Cylinder</em> can be
        used to visualize streamlines without showing orientation (curl).
        <em>Ellipse</em>, <em>rectangle</em> and <em>ribbon</em> types will
        enable visualization of the direction of the vector orthogonal to the
        streamline direction.</li>
      <li>Length: Enter a value into this box to set the length of the
        streamline/s.</li>
      <li>Width: Enter a value into this box to set the width of the
        streamline/s.</li>
      <li>Stream vector: This drop-down box allows you to select the vector
        that is being visualized by the streamlines.</li>
      <li>Reverse: Checking this box reverses the streamline.</li>
      <li>Seed element: Checking this box allows you to select the single
        element number from which the streamline will be seeded.</li>
      <li>Xi: Entering three comma-separated values (between 0 and 1) allows
        you to set the xi location within elements from which streamlines will
        be seeded.</li>
    </ul>
    <p></p>
  </li>
</ul>
