Zinc Python bindings
====================

Zinc provides Python bindings to the visualisation library.
There are some examples available at https://somwhere.like.here.
A typical usage often starts with creating a Context like this::

  from opencmiss.zinc import context
  c = context.Context.create("my-context")

There are some very cool things you can visualize with this library, like DICOM images, Hermite meshes and so on.

First Steps
===========

The examples are the best place for getting started with Zinc Python bindings.
