 * Sets the number of components in return field to the product of the number
 * of components in the <source_field> and <coordinate_field>.
 * Note the <source_field> does not have to be a scalar. If it has more than 1
 * component, all the derivatives of its first component w.r.t. the components
 * of <coordinate_field> will be returned first, followed by the second
 * component, etc. Hence, this function can return the standard gradient of a
 * scalar source_field, and the deformation gradient if a deformed coordinate
 * field is passed as the source_field.
 * The gradient can also be calculated at nodes, albeit approximately using a
 * finite difference approach by perturbing the coordinate field.
