/**
 * Creates a field which calculates the numerical integral over the mesh of 
 * integrand.dV for volume in 3-D, dA for area in 2-D, dL for length in 1-D.
 * Returned field has same number of components as the integrand field,
 * with each component integrated separately.
 * By default, the integral is calculated by 1-point Gaussian quadrature,
 * sufficient only for linear interpolation. Separate methods are available to
 * set the numbers of quadrature points.
 * Note: uses absolute value of dV/dA/dL so works with right- or left- handed
 * element local coordinate systems. However, cannot handle elements that are
 * partly or completely inverted from expected handedness.

 * spurious modes in many numerical solutions. Simplex elements use specialised
 * point arrangements that are sufficient for integrating a polynomial with the
